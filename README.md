# ChatgptClone
This project allows users to create new conversations with the bot or continue existing ones.

You can interact with the bot by sending a message via the search field.

The left-hand menu shows the conversation history, 
By clicking on a conversation from the list, you'll be redirected to the corresponding chat at /chat/:id. 

Alternatively, you can start a new conversation by sending a message through the main path.

## Run 
```
git clone https://github.com/davidazulay9573/chatgpt-clone
```
To ensure the bot service functions properly, make sure to update the apikey in /services/bot.
```
ng serve
```

 Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
